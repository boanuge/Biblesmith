â€» The Bible-smith Project: "The Gospel for Everyone"

This project develops any kind of Bible related Apps/Info. for more effective and efficient evangelism.

ps. Please walk together with this project by prayer, and you can send us the Bible text (VPL: Verse Per Line Format) in any language where needs the gospel. We will develop a Bible android app. of that language. (Every process and product are free of charge. ;)
