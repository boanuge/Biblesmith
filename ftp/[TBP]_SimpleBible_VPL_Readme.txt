Dear Brother/Sister,

It is pleasure to develop a Bible app in your local language, and thank you for the care for His kingdom.
To create the Bible app, a Bible VPL file is needed in your language.

This link(http://mannam.cc/ftp/[TBP]_SimpleBible_VPL4Hebrew_TXT.html) is a sample Bible VPL in Hebrew language,
and this link(http://mannam.cc/ftp/[TBP]_SimpleBible_VPL3LetterBibleBookNames_TXT.html) is a 3 letter Bible book names to be used in your VPL file.

These Bible book names (in English) need to be used at the beginning of each line to specify the book. Please refer the above sample VPL.
(Save the VPL file using the UTF-8 encoding so the special text can be preserved)

All the processes of developing the Bible app are free of charge. So do not worry about the money.
You are welcome to ask any questions. We are happy to help for His sake.

With love of Jesus,
Boanuge
