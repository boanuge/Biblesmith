● I HAVE BEEN PRAYING FOR YOU

As I wrote this book, I often prayed that you would experience the incredible sense of hope, energy, and joy that comes from discovering what God put you on this planet to do. There's nothing quite like it. I am excited because I know all the great things that are going to happen to you. They happened to me, and I have never been the same since I discovered the purpose of
my life.

Because I know the benefits, I want to challenge you to stick with this spiritual journey for the next 40 days, not missing a single daily reading. Your life is worth taking the time to think about it. Make it a daily appointment on your schedule. If you will commit to this, let's sign a covenant together. There is something significant about signing your name to a commitment. If you get a partner to read through this with you, have him or her sign it, too. Let's get started together!

● Discussion Questions

I strongly urge you to get one or more friends to join you in reading this book during the next 40 days. A journey is always better when it is shared. With a partner or a small reading group you can discuss what you read and bounce ideas off each other. This will help you grow stronger and deeper spiritually. Real spiritual growth is never an isolated, individualistic pursuit. Maturity is produced through relationships and community.

The best way to explain God's purpose for your life is to allow the Scripture to speak for itself, so in this book the Bible is quoted extensively, using over a thousand different verses from fifteen English translations and paraphrases. I have varied the versions used for several important reasons, which I explain in appendix 3.

[DISCUSSION QUESTIONS]

In addition to the questions at the end of each chapter, you can use these discussion questions in your small group or Sunday school class setting.

WHAT ON EARTH AM I HERE FOR?

* What do you think are implications of the first sentence of this book, "It's not about you"?
* What do you feel most people's lives are driven by? What has been the driving force in your life?
* Up to this point, what image or metaphor has best described your life? A race, a circus, something else?
* If everyone understood that life on earth is really preparation for eternity, how would we act differently?
* What do people get attached to on earth that keeps them from living for God's purposes?
* What have you been attached to that could keep you from living for God's purposes?

YOU WERE PLANNED FOR GOD'S PLEASURE

* How is "living your whole life for God's pleasure" different from the way most people understand "worship"?
* How is a friendship with God similar to any other friendship, and how is it different?
* Share something you learned from a time when God seemed distant.
* Which is easier for you-public or private worship? In which do you usually feel closer to God?
* When is it appropriate to express anger to God?
* What fears surface when you think of surrendering your complete life to Christ?

YOU WERE FORMED FOR GOD'S FAMILY

* How is "being as committed to each other as we are to Jesus Christ" different from the way most people understand "fellowship"?
* What are the barriers that keep us from loving and caring for other believers?
* What would make it easier for you to be able to share your needs, hurts, fears, and hopes with others?
* What are the most common excuses people give for not joining a church, and how would you answer them?
* What could our group do to protect and promote the unity in our church?
* Is there someone you need to restore a relationship with that we could pray for you about?

YOU WERE CREATED TO BECOME LIKE CHRIST

* How is "becoming like Jesus Christ" different from the way most people understand "discipleship"?
* What are some of the changes you have seen in your life since you became a believer? What have others noticed?
* A year from now, how would you like to be more Christlike? What can you do today to move toward that goal?
* Where in your spiritual growth are you having to be patient because there seems to be little progress?
* How has God used pain or trouble to help you grow?
* When are you most vulnerable to temptation? Which of the steps to defeating temptation could help you most?

YOU WERE SHAPED FOR SERVING GOD

* How is "using your shape to serve others" different from the way most people understand "ministry"?
* What do you love to do that you could use to serve others in the family of God?
* Think of a painful experience you have gone through that God could use to help others who are going through the same kind of situation.
* How does comparing ourselves with others keep us from fully developing our unique shape?
* How have you seen God's power demonstrated through you when you felt weak?
* How can we help every member of our small group or class find a place of ministry? What can our group do to serve our church family?

YOU WERE MADE FOR A MISSION

* What are some typical fears and stereotypes that people have when they hear the word "evangelism"? What keeps you from sharing the Good News with others?
* What do you feel might be a part of the Life Message that God has given you to share with the world?
* Share the name of a unbelieving friend that everyone in your group can begin praying for.
* What can our group do together to help fulfill the Great Commission?
* How has reading through this book together refocused or redirected your life purpose? What have been some of the most helpful insights to you?
* Who does God bring to mind that you could share the life changing message of this book with?
* What are we going to study next? (See appendix 2 for suggestions.)
